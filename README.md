# facebookbrute
This is facebook bruteforce project. It uses Selenium to brute facebook so you will get maximum chances of success and for every 2 attempts it changes IP adrress and the whole process will runs on TOR so, you are safe.

[You will need python!]

[Note: Only Facebook Bruteforce is working]

CREDIT:

  This project was developed from brut3k1t,which was made by dillibk777.
  Here is the page : https://github.com/ex0dus-0x/brut3k1t
  Since this script was not functionning, and was not ready for a attack, so I decided to develop this program from his.

  This project is combined with another project TORIPTABLES2.thanks to ruped24.

----------------  How To Use ----------------

Get the requirements:
    
    chmod +x fbrute.py && chmod +x setup.py && chmod +x torip.py
    python setup.py

Command:

    python fbrute.py -s [service] -u [username] -w [wordlist] -d [delay(Optional)]

Examples:

  

    python fbrute.py -s facebook -u useremail@gmail.com -w /root/passwd.txt -d 10

    (Execute facebook brutefurece) (facebook)  (Email of the target)  (wordlist path)   (delay[10secs])


  

Memorize:

    -s, -u, -w parameters are must, and -d is optional.

    -d in default is 1 sec.

    In facebook, you would have to type the email in the -u.

    In facebook, the script will ask you the Name of the target.

How it works:

   This script uses selenium web driver, and Xvfb and pyvirtualdisplay to make the web driver invisible so you can keep doing work, this script also uses STEM as the proxy. And by using toriptables2 script it will changes IP for every 2 attempts.
